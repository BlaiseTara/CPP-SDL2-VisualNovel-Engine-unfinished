1.
Convert my engine and sdl all into 1 .dll.
Create a compiler that converts my custom script code into C++ code.
bundle G++ compiler into the compiler program.

2.
Create a Compiler program that turns all custom script files into 1 binary file.
engine.exe then runs that file.

Example:
Syntax and machine code is just made up

Custom script:

int VarName = 1;


Machine Code:

0x32    // Tells engine that we are creating a new var
0x00    // Tells engine that var should be an int16
0x03    // Memory location Part 1
0x02    // Memory location Part 2
0x01    // Loads the The Number 1

// What this does:
Creates a new integer at memory location 0x0302 (hex will be comverted to decimal to use as array index)
loads the hex value 0x01 into it
